# landingpage

This is my simple [personal landing page] (http://debilux.org).

It consists of a plain old html file, some java script, an .htaccess file, a nice photo of mine and a logo.

## Install

All you have to do is replace the images and edit the stuff in the index.htm and the .htaccess.

Throw it on your server and you're done :)
